            I currently work as a Senior Developer on SpamTitan at TitanHQ. I work primarily
            in Laravel PHP, framework-less PHP, Perl, and Javascript. I work on the full stack,
            working on both the front-end web-GUI as well as the appliance back-end, and the
            full CI/CD process as well.
            </p>

            <p class="my-5">
            In addition to that though, I also try to contribute some of my freetime to
            open source software. See the <a class="text-indigo-400 no-underline hover:underline" href="/projects">projects</a> page to see what I have done.
            </p>

            <p class="my-5">
            Outside of the tech sphere, I have a passion for board games, love to travel and
            see new things.
