### VS Code

I have quite a few extensions running in VS Code, and I very much adore my theme.

- **Theme**: Palenight
- **File Icon Theme**: Material Icon Theme
- **Extensions**:
    - Atom Keymap (With a lot of custom key combinations as well)
    - Bookmarks
    - indent-rainbow
    - GitLens
    - PHP Intelephense (Paid version; Basically a must for PHP Programming)
    - Toggle Quotes (I wish this worked better, more like Atom's. How anyone works without it, is beyond me though)
    - Bracket Pair Colorizer 2
    - Many, many more that are language specific, and only use a small amount of the time
