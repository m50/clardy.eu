<h1 align="center">About me</h1>

Hi! I'm Marisa! I'm a native Texan who has a passion for development.

I currently work as a Senior Developer on SpamTitan at TitanHQ. I work primarily
in Laravel PHP, framework-less PHP, Perl, and Javascript. I work on the full stack,
working on both the front-end web-GUI as well as the appliance back-end, and the
full CI/CD process as well.

In addition to that though, I also try to contribute some of my freetime to
open source software. See the [projects](projects) page to see what I have done.

Outside of the tech sphere, I have a passion for board games, love to travel and
see new things.
