## My blog is finally up and running!

I spent the day finishing my implementation, and now it's ready to go.

This post is proof that my blog is now up and running!

I plan on using this blog to talk about:

 - Things I have learned
 - Things I plan on learning
 - Useful tips and tricks
 - My releases and OSS contributions
 - Being an LGBTQ woman in Tech

This is probably going to be one of the shortest, and least interesting blog
posts.

There is more to come in the future, so keep an eye out! Also check out
