## Personal Notes

I have been programming for the majority of my life, starting with Game Development and working on
personal assistants when I was young to working in Web Development as an adult.

I am an advocate for easily maintainable code, that even new developers can hop onto.

I have always dreamed of building a truly intelligent house, and have been a big fan
of home automation and personal assistants, and working on it for years.

## Work Experience

- **GoDaddy** - *Senior Software Engineer* (November 2021 - Present)
  - Developed critical services for the new Managed WooCommerce Stores platform up post-merger
    > Services included modern rewrites of old code, as well as translation layers and clients for the greater
    > GoDaddy ecosystem. To work on these, I was required to design and spec out the work, as well as implement
    > much of the foundational core for these services and tools.
  - Lead developer on V2 development for the Managed WooCommerce Stores platform
    > Version 2 is an extensive change from our older platform under Pagely, and requires an extensive
    > redesign and rewrite to get working. To achieve this, I was set out to lead projects
    > through the initial conception stage all the way to completion, working closely with my
    > colleagues and planning out the work that is necessary.
  - Migrating CDN provider for customers
    > Was a lead developer on migrating CDN providers from AWS CloudFront to Cloudflare
    > due to missing features in AWS CloudFront. This switch provided faster setup times
    > and better performance for our customers.
  - Maintenance of the in-house web framework
    > The in-house framework used on the Pagely architecture has been in development for many years
    > and I have been tasked to lead the charge on modernizing it and making it more feature rich
    > and useful for employees, while removing a lot of technical debt. Some notable improvements
    > are: fixing issues related to validation and authentication, allowing unauthenticated users
    > to investigate unvalidated data structures; Ability to deprecate endpoints and record and
    > clean up all cases where an endpoint should no longer be used; And introducing new testing tools
    > to speed up test writing and create better more thorough tests.
